python automation quiz application using Tkinter
Built a python automation quiz application using Tkinter. 
The application requested for the user’s name and email address before the start of the quiz.
Each quiz test was programmed to be a total of 20 randomly selected questions from this quiz api: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=50&category=9&difficulty=easy&type=multiple.  
At the end of the quiz, the total mark and time taken to complete the quiz was displayed on the application.
An email was also sent to the user’s email stating the user’s score and a file attachment of the user’s response and correct answer for every question failed by the user.
